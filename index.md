## My favortie labs 
Lab 11 Part 1

I liked this part of the lab the most because we had to use multiple CSV and other files to make the correct outputs of the data we were given and I thought that was interesting. 

Lab 4 Part 1

This was another one of my favorites. It was the first lab in which we used the double variable, and it played a big role throughout the remainder of our class. It played such a big role that I thought it should be here, along with the fact that the way it works is very intriguing.  

Lab 6 part 2

Assigning variables to cards and then giving those card numbers finally using that complies and play blackjack with the user that uses the user's inputs to play a game with them with the objective of it to not surpass 21 with this level of coding and the way its used I can be replaced and done with other things.
